<h1>About Sanpaku Eyes: careful, international eye health information</h1>

<section id="mission">
<h2>Our purpose</h2>
<p>Sanpaku Eyes was created to provide clear, evidence-aware information about a term that is often misunderstood and surrounded by misinformation. Our mission is to clarify what sanpaku eyes are, explain the difference between cultural folklore and clinical reality, and encourage appropriate eye care when needed. We aim to reduce unnecessary anxiety, counter unfounded claims, and support informed decision-making for an international audience.</p>
<p>The term "sanpaku eyes" describes a distinctive eye appearance where the sclera (the white part of the eye) is visible below the iris. While this appearance has cultural and historical associations, it is not a medical diagnosis. Many people naturally have this eye characteristic due to their unique facial anatomy, eyelid position, or the way their eyes sit within the orbital socket. Our goal is to help readers understand this distinction and focus on genuine health indicators rather than appearance-based interpretations.</p>
<p>We recognise that people searching for information about sanpaku eyes may have a range of concerns—from curiosity about the term's meaning to worries about their own eye health. By providing balanced, supportive content that respects both cultural context and medical evidence, we hope to serve as a reliable starting point for understanding this topic. We also emphasise the importance of consulting qualified eye care professionals for personalised advice and clinical assessment.</p>
<p>This website covers topics including sanpaku eyes meaning, types of sanpaku eyes, common characteristics, cultural references such as sanpaku eyes in anime, and general eye health information. We do not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. Instead, we offer educational content that can help you ask informed questions and know when to seek professional care.</p>
